# Utility functions

Miscellaneous of different utility functions developed in Python.

## Topics

Most of the scripts are related to:

 - Tensorflow functions for the object detection API
 - Tracking
 - Data association 
 - Use of models with TensorRT 
 - Creation of ROI
 - Jetson Nano GPIO Class

The TensorRT utilities was based on [AastaNV/TRT_object_detection](https://github.com/AastaNV/TRT_object_detection) Github.
